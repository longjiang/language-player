# Notes Reader

Paste or write text in your target language and read it with interactive word lookup, per-block translations, and a built-in note-taking system.

## How It Works

The Notes Reader lets you bring your own text — paste an article, type a journal entry, or load a web page. The reader tokenizes the text so every word becomes clickable. You can look up words in the dictionary, see translations, and save everything as a note that you can return to later.

## Getting Text In

There are three ways to add text:

- **Write or paste** — Switch to the Edit tab and type or paste directly into the text area. Markdown formatting is supported (headings, lists, blockquotes, code, tables).
- **Load a URL** — Paste a web page URL into the URL input at the top. The reader fetches the page and converts it to readable text.
- **Fill with sample** — Click "Fill with sample" to load a short example text in your target language, useful for exploring the reader's features.

Each piece of text you work with is saved as a **note**. All your notes appear in the sidebar on the left. Click any note to load it back — your text, translations, and reading position are remembered.

## Reading

### Edit Mode

The **Edit** tab is where you add or edit text. Type directly into the text area, or paste from an external source. When you're ready to read, click **Tokenize** to make every word interactive.

Markdown is fully supported. Use `#` for headings, `*` or `-` for lists, `>` for blockquotes, and backticks for code. The reader preserves your formatting in the Read tab.

### Read Mode

The **Read** tab shows your text paginated to fit the screen. Each page shows as much text as fits without scrolling.

**Navigate pages** with the `←` `→` buttons at the bottom, or use your keyboard: `←` and `↑` for previous page, `→`, `↓`, and `Space` for next page.

## Interactive Words

After tokenization, every word is clickable. Tap or click any word to open the [Popup Dictionary](/docs/vocab/popup-dictionary). You can see definitions, pronunciations, example sentences, and save the word to your vocabulary.

Words you've previously saved are shown with a quick gloss — the first definition appears inline next to the word.

## {$action.translation}

Toggle the **{$action.translation}** switch in the page navigation bar to show or hide translations. This setting is remembered across sessions.

When enabled, translations appear inline — on wide screens they sit next to the original text, and on narrow screens they appear below each paragraph. Translations are fetched per page and appear as you navigate.

**Per-block actions** let you interact with each paragraph individually. Hover over any text block to reveal a `⋮` menu with these options:

- **{$action.copy}** — {$action.copy} the text to your clipboard
- **{$action.speak}** — Read the text aloud with text-to-speech
- **AI Explain** — Get an AI breakdown of the text's grammar and structure
- **{$action.translation}** — See a popup translation for just that block

## Managing Notes

All your notes appear in the sidebar. You can:

- **Create a new note** — Click "New Note" to start with a blank text area
- **Rename a note** — Click the `⋮` next to a note and choose Rename
- **Delete a note** — Click the `⋮` next to a note and choose Delete

Your note is saved as you type. There's no save button — changes are saved to your account after a brief pause. When you switch between notes or close the reader, your latest changes are always preserved.

## Tips

- Use markdown headings to organize longer texts — they help break content into readable sections
- The `⋮` menu on each block is a quick way to look up a single word or phrase without switching tabs
- Keyboard navigation (`←` `→`) is faster than clicking page buttons for extended reading
- Rename your notes to something descriptive — "Chapter 3 notes" is easier to find later than "Untitled"
